                            the car accelerates until it reaches the speed limit, and then remains at this speed.  If another car is in its safety gap the car brakes
                            - with increasing severity according to the distance between the cars - so that the cars do not crash.</td>

                            The car behind (which is still travelling at the faster speed) then finds the first car within its safety gap.  This car then 
                            brakes, which leads to the car behind it finding it within its safety gap.  This process continues creating a traffic jam 
                            at the start of the speed restriction - as seen in Figure 2.</td>

                            the car at the start of the jam has no cars in front of it and so accelerates to the speed limit.  
                            The car behind it can then also accelerate.  Thus cars escape from the front of the traffic jam.</td>
