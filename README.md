# personal-website

Code for my personal website

Most of this is 10 to 20 years old but it's about time I started updating it and GitHub source control would be useful.

You can view the website straight from this code at: https://laurencesmithpersonal.github.io/personal-website/index.html

or the actual website at: www.laurencesmith.net
